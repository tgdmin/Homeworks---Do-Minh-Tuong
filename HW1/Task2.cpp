//An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a two dots â€” bottom left and top right. User writes the dots for two rectangles as two lines with four numbers in each:
//x1 y1 x2 y2
//X1 Y1 X2 Y2
//where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of first rectangle bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.
//Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
//Given two axis-aligned rectangles, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.
